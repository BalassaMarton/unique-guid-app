# Unique GUID Checker - Joke Website

Welcome to the Unique GUID Checker joke website! This site, generated with ChatGPT, is a humorous project created for entertainment purposes, simulating a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) checking application that playfully claims to determine the uniqueness of GUIDs.

## About

This joke website presents a fictional application that humorously pretends to check whether a provided GUID is truly unique or not. It's important to note that this website is purely a parody and doesn't actually perform any real GUID uniqueness checks.

## How It Works

The website features a simple interface where users can enter a GUID-like string into a text box and click the "Check" button. After a short animated spinner delay, the website playfully generates either a green checkmark with a congratulatory message (if the entered "GUID" is deemed "unique") or a red cross mark with a message (if the entered "GUID" is not considered "unique").
